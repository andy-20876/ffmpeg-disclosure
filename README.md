# FFmpeg License Disclosure for FourClicks Media Manager

This repository provides open-source licensing disclosure for the custom FFmpeg build used in the FourClicks Media Manager desktop application.

---

## üì¶ About This FFmpeg Build

The application includes a custom-built version of **FFmpeg version 7.1**, licensed under the **LGPL v2.1** (or later). This build was configured to enable H.264 video encoding through Cisco's OpenH264 library and to remain fully LGPL-compliant.

### üîß Build Configuration
To rebuild FFmpeg with the same configuration:

```bash
./configure --disable-gpl --enable-libopenh264 --disable-libx264 --disable-libx265 
make

--disable-gpl: Ensures that GPL-only features are excluded so that the resulting binary stays under the LGPL license.
--disable-libx264 --disable-libx265:  Specifically exclude those two functions so that the resulting binary stays under the LGPL license.
--enable-libopenh264: Adds support for H.264 encoding using the Cisco OpenH264 codec (licensed under the BSD 2-Clause License).

This FFmpeg binary is dynamically linked and unmodified, and users are free to rebuild, replace, or relink it as needed.
